# Weather forecast React

The React framework and responsive design were used so that the page opens on any device.

The user can select a city from the list for which he needs a weather forecast.

The user has the opportunity to view data for the following time periods:

• “now” (for the day);

• “the next five days” (by day for five days). Data is requested via OpenWeather's One Call API.

What to do to make it work:

Install dependencies in the terminal (npm i)

"npm run dev" -> for server deploying! "npm run build" -> for project building!
